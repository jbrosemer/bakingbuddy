Have you ever read, “Place the dry ingredients in a large bowl and whisk”, and thought “I have no desire to bake anymore”, I know I have! Although for many baking can be therapeutic and enjoyable, but for others it can be a tedious chore. Well now the hard part is out of your hands! Using our Baking Buddy, you can mix all the dry ingredients together for any recipe with just the press of a couple buttons. Just pick your ingredient, how much you want, and you’re on your way to becoming a professional baker!
